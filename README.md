# android-content-provider

  Client side store for data access / persistence.
  
  Would advise at the Provider level to add switching / logic that states weather your storing to the internal sqlite db or firing off HTTP's to a web service.

## Installation

  Tis a Android Studio workspace, should be able to import it.
